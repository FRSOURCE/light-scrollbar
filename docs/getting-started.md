# Getting started

Hello traveler! Nice to see you here, I've created this plugin because there is no such functionality on the market. Usually plugins alter a lot DOM just to replace scrollbar so it would be customizable. I wanted to do smallest possible DOM change.

Still plugin need to wrap your container with another element, however there is no additional "real" elements for scrollbar itself, those are created with `pseudo elements`.

For instalation example and example code please go to [INSTALLATION](/instalation) page.
In order to check current api please navigate to [API](/api) page.

Any contribution or filing feature or bug tickets will be highly apprecated.
Thank you for using this plugin !.
