Nice to see you here, I&#39;ve created this plugin because there is no such functionality on the market. Usually plugins alter a lot DOM just to replace scrollbar so it would be customizable. I wanted to do smallest possible DOM change.</p><p>Still plugin need to wrap your container with another element, however there is no additional &quot;real&quot; elements for scrollbar itself, those are created with <code>pseudo elements</code>.</p><p>For instalation example and example code please go to <a href="/light-scrollbar/instalation.html">INSTALLATION</a> page. In order to check current api please navigate to <a href="/light-scrollbar/api.html">API</a> page.</p><p>Any contribution or filing feature or bug tickets will be highly apprecated. Thank you for using this plugin !.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">FEATURES</p><p>Please let me know if you need any new feature or idea, that will be greatly appreciated ! ðŸ˜ƒ</p></div>',6),l=[i];function s(n,c,d,p,h,u){return a(),t("div",null,l)}const m=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{_ as __pageData,m as default};
